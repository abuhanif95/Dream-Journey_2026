JavaScript Loops & Control 

1. WHILE LOOPS
   - Basic while loop syntax
   - Loop variable initialization, condition checking, and incrementation
   - Printing sequences and accumulating sums

2. FOR LOOPS
   - Standard for loop: for (initialization; condition; increment)
   - Looping forward and in reverse
   - Using step values (e.g., i += 2 for even/odd sequences)

3. CONDITIONAL LOGIC INSIDE LOOPS
   - Filtering even/odd numbers using modulo (%)
   - Finding numbers divisible by 3, 5, or both
   - Accumulating totals with conditions

4. LOOP CONTROL STATEMENTS
   - break: exit the loop prematurely
   - continue: skip the current iteration and continue to the next

5. DO-WHILE LOOPS
   - Syntax: do { ... } while (condition)
   - Ensures the loop body runs at least once
