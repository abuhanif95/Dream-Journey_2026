    <p>I can <em>write</em> a <i>paragraph</i> in website</p>

    <p>
      I will watch videos, practice modules, and if i got stuck, i will ask for
      help and i will <strong>never give up</strong> to <b>learn</b> and i am <p>serious</p> to work hard to
      become a web developer and crack a job or intern. I know this is possible
      but it is not easy.
