# VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM, GIT & GITHUB

## 1. WHAT IS VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM (VCS)?
A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps developers track and manage changes to source code over time. 
It's like a "time machine" for your code.

### Key Features of VCS:
- Track every change made to files
- Revert to any previous version
- Compare changes over time
- Work on multiple features simultaneously
- Collaborate with other developers
- Backup and restore code

### Types of VCS:
1. LOCAL VCS: Track changes on your own computer
2. CENTRALIZED VCS: Single server stores all versions
3. DISTRIBUTED VCS: Every developer has complete copy of repository

### Why Use VCS?
- Backup and restore capability
- Track who changed what and when
- Experiment safely without breaking working code
- Collaborate efficiently in teams
- Maintain project history
- Deploy different versions


## 2. GIT - DISTRIBUTED VERSION CONTROL SYSTEM
Git is a FREE, open-source, distributed version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 (creator of Linux).

### What is Git?
- Tool installed on your LOCAL computer
- Manages version control locally
- Tracks changes in source code
- Creates snapshots (commits) of your project
- Works offline (no internet needed)
- Command-line tool with GUI options available

### Key Git Concepts:
1. REPOSITORY: Project folder tracked by Git (.git folder)
2. COMMIT: Snapshot of changes with message
3. BRANCH: Independent line of development
4. MERGE: Combine changes from different branches
5. CLONE: Copy repository to local machine
6. PUSH: Send local changes to remote repository
7. PULL: Get changes from remote repository

### Basic Git Commands:
git init          # Start new repository
git add .         # Stage all changes
git commit -m "message"  # Save snapshot
git status        # Check current state
git log           # View commit history
git branch        # List/create branches
git checkout      # Switch branches
git merge         # Combine branches
git clone         # Copy remote repo locally
git push          # Send to remote
git pull          # Get from remote

### Git Workflow:
1. Make changes to files
2. Stage changes (git add)
3. Commit changes (git commit)
4. Push to remote (git push)


## 3. GITHUB - CLOUD HOSTING PLATFORM
GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories with additional collaboration features.

### What is GitHub?
- Website (github.com) owned by Microsoft
- Hosts Git repositories in the cloud
- Provides web-based interface
- Adds collaboration features
- Requires internet connection
- Free for public repositories

### GitHub Features:
1. REPOSITORY HOSTING: Store code in cloud
2. COLLABORATION TOOLS: Issues, Projects, Discussions
3. PULL REQUESTS: Code review workflow
4. ACTIONS: CI/CD automation
5. PAGES: Free static website hosting
6. SECURITY SCANNING: Vulnerability detection
7. COMMUNITY: Open source projects

### GitHub vs GitLab vs Bitbucket:
- GitHub: Most popular, Microsoft-owned
- GitLab: More DevOps features, self-hostable
- Bitbucket: Atlassian product, good Jira integration



## 4. GIT vs GITHUB - KEY DIFFERENCES

### Git (Local Tool):
- Software you INSTALL on computer
- Works OFFLINE
- Manages version control
- Command-line interface
- Free and open-source
- Created by Linus Torvalds
- You run it locally

### GitHub (Cloud Service):
- Website you VISIT
- Requires INTERNET
- Hosts repositories
- Web-based interface
- Free/paid plans
- Owned by Microsoft
- You use it online

### Analogy:
Git = Word Processing Software (like Microsoft Word)
GitHub = Google Docs (cloud storage + collaboration)
