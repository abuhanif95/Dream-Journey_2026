# DAILY LEARNING SUMMARY - CSS Positioning, Pseudo-classes & Pseudo-elements

Date: 10 January 2026
Topic: Advanced CSS Selectors and Positioning

## WHAT I LEARNED TODAY:

### 1. CSS PSEUDO-CLASSES:
- **:hover**: Applied to change styling when elements are hovered over
- **:focus**: Used for styling form inputs when they receive focus
- **:visited**: Styled visited links differently from unvisited ones
- **:first-child**: Selected and styled the first child element
- **:last-child**: Selected and styled the last child element
- **:nth-child()**: Used patterns (like 2n) to style alternating elements

### 2. CSS POSITIONING PROPERTIES:
- **Static**: Default positioning (follows normal document flow)
- **Relative**: Positioned relative to its normal position
- **Absolute**: Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor
- **Fixed**: Positioned relative to viewport (stays fixed during scrolling)
- **Sticky**: Hybrid between relative and fixed positioning

### 3. Z-INDEX:
- Learned to control stacking order of positioned elements
- Higher z-index values bring elements to the front
- Only works on positioned elements (non-static)

### 4. PSEUDO-ELEMENTS:
- **::before**: Inserted content before element's actual content
- **::after**: Inserted content after element's actual content
- **::first-letter**: Styled the first letter of paragraphs differently
- **::first-line**: Applied styles to the first line of text
- **::selection**: Customized text selection colors
- **::placeholder**: Styled placeholder text in form inputs
